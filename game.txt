    # Each Vector has an x and y coord and cannot be changed

    # Vectors can be added together by combining their x and y values

    # Make Vectors return true when they are both the same

# Create Map class
    # Init:
        # Create Map width variable
        # Create Map depth variable
        # Create list of valid Vectors using width and depth
        # Create dictionary of objects using Vectors as the key
        # Populate dictionary with blocks and spawn the player near the top (Generate Map)

    # To-string:
        # Use to-string to display map contents on screen

    # Generate Map:
        # Iterate through map Dictionary and place Air blocks on top with dirt and ore blocks underneath
   
        # Also place the player on the top

# Create resource blocks(Air, Dirt ,Iron, Stone)  

# Create Character class:
    # Init:
        # Create name variable
        # Create health variable
        # Create maximum air time variable
        # Create variable to store when the player jumped
        # Create direction to move Vector
        # Create isFalling bool
        # Create isOnGround bool

    # Only for debug

    # Create getters and setters:
 
    # When isFalling is checked:
        # If the character has beed in the air for too long:
            # Set isFalling to true
        # Return isFalling

    # When isFalling is set:
        # If setting isFalling to true
            # Also set isOnGround to true

    # When setting isOnGround:
        # Store old variable for is OnGround
        # If isOnGround goes from True to False:
            # Record time that the jump occurred to timeJumped variable
        # If setting isOnGround to True:
            # Also set isFalling to False

# Create Level object to store current char and map. Also runs game logic.
    # Character, Map, and enemy variables

    # Go through the levels map to find all objects that need to move:
        # Create Vector for Character location

                # Set the Character to isOnGround = False
            # Else
                # Set the Character to isOnGround = True
        # If there is no block below them(of the map):
            # Set the Character to isOnGround = True

        # If the character is falling set their direction to down:

        # Find the block that the Character wants to move to:
            # If the Character wants to move up:
                # If the block is Dirt:
                    # And the Character is not falling
                        # Damage the block

            # If the character wants to move in any other direction(other than up):

                    # Move in that direction
